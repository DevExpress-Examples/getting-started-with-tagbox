# DevExtreme React TagBox - Getting Started 

This repository stores the code examples of the React TagBox component for the [Getting Started with TagBox](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/TagBox/Getting_Started_with_TagBox/) tutorial. The TagBox is an editor that allows users to select multiple items from a drop-down list. This tutorial explains how to add a TagBox to a page, populate the drop-down list, allow users to search through it, and log the data of the selected item in the console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for more information.
